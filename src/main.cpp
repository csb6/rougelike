/*TODO:
[ ] Profile to see what is causing memory leaks when resizing window
[X] Make plain function for reading/return 2d array of map
[X] Implement proper scrolling; look at this link: http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Scrolling_map
[X] Add vector of all actors/entities? in current level, way to cycle through their turns
[X] Add way to have player Actor in vector but also with a reference in GameBoard
[X] Add basic UI for showing who's turn it is, how many energy steps left
[X] Fix bug where turn indicator won't update until player tries to move with 0 energy
[X] Establish better lines of communication between Display and GameBoard so
    references don't have to be passed around so ad-hoc
[X] Call screen.present() in only 1 spot every tick: right after updateActors()
[X] Implement way to automatically show name/energy of entity whose turn it is
[X] Add way to draw GUI without using absolute positioning
[ ] Add way to specify characteristics of monsters in text config files, which can
    then be loaded when the program starts
[ ] Add way to save/load maps
[ ] Add Item, Chest classes, related code from old RPG project
[ ] Add screen/functionality to interact with/transfer items to/from Chests,
    as well as drop items from inventory
[X] Add inventory system
[ ] Add basic test suite for key functionality (see old RPG code)
[ ] Add RNG functionality (see old RPG code)
[ ] Add more comprehensive way to view larger inventory
[ ] Add better, safer, more comprehensive way to draw GUI
[ ] Add way to equip items/armor
[ ] Find way to gracefully exit; use it in loadMapFile()'s error branch
