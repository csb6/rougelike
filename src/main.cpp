/*TODO:
[ ] Profile to see what is causing memory leaks when resizing window
[ ] Add way to save/load
[ ] Add way to drop items onto map (remove from inventory)
[X] Add basic test suite for key functionality (see old RPG code)
[ ] Add better, safer, more comprehensive way to draw GUI
[ ] Add better, faster way to get ref to Item from an (x, y) coordinate
[X] Add isPlayer flag to Actor class to clearly differentiate player from
    monsters without having to do dynamic dispatch/inheritance stuff
[X] Add way to equip items/armor
[ ] Add armor/weapon items that improve defense/attack
[X] Add way to specify items in .ini files
[X] Add variable damage
[ ] Tune combat/limit teleportation
[ ] Make some more maps to play
[ ] Add support for 'stair' tiles that allow you to move between lvels
[ ] Adjust skills; maybe have teleport skill, use it to determine range? Maybe
    use cunning skill?
[ ] Improve Monster AI to avoid barriers; maybe use A* again?
[ ] Add procedural map generator code
[X] Delete skills that aren't useful/usable
[ ] Reference melee skill and strength skill for attacking; factor in armor
    and agility for defense
[ ] Add 'negotiate' option with monsters that generates funny dialogue
    (e.g. low-negotiate skill player: "Hey, Commie bastard, want to surrender
    so I can kill you somewhat quicker?")
[ ] Find way to gracefully exit; use it in loadMap()'s error branch
[ ] Add keybindings file loaded on start
[ ] Test map file loading code on Windows (possibly using Wine?)
