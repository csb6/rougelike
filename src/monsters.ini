#Lines starting with # are comments; they will be ignored
#This file contains data used to construct different varieties of monsters
#An empty line with a newline separates each definition
#
#`icon` means the character representing the monster on the game map
#`=default` means the program assigns the generic value for that trait
#Values (text on right side of `=`) can have a '=' in them, but not as
#the first character. Each field expects a certain value (string, integer, or
#character), so putting the wrong type as a value will probably crash the game
