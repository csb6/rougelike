Title: Tele-Comrade

You are an "elite" foot soldier of the United States of America. It is your duty as your nation's (ahem) finest warrior to descend into a dungeon of Communist abominations and assassinate General Secretary Pinko, the devious and genius scientist behind the terrifying monsters you encounter.

Monsters include:
[X] Gulag guard dogs
[ ] White Russians (just normal Russian dudes wearing...linen)
[ ] Hollywood Screenwriters
[ ] Surly Swedes
[ ] Canadian lumberjacks
[X] Marxist Marmots
[ ] Siberian Mammoths
[ ] Trotskyist Yaks
[ ] Wolves
[X] Mutant bears
[ ] Radioactive reindeer
[ ] Giant bees
[ ] Chapaev
[ ] Sentient piles of goo
[ ] Five-armed commissars
[ ] Tanks
[ ] Sentient hammers and sickles
[X] Red Imps
[ ] Bourgeiose wererabbits
[ ] ...And other filthy and mutated abominations

Thanks to your highly experimental and definitely safe Boeing Teleporter-737-MAX, you will have a dimensional edge over the Red Bastards. Use it to blink through walls and massacre the enemies of the state.
