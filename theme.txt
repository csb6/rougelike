Title: Tele-Comrade

You are an "elite" foot soldier of the United States of America. It is your duty as your nation's (ahem) finest warrior to descend into a dungeon of Communist abominations and assassinate General Secretary Pinko, the devious and genius scientist behind the terrifying monsters you encounter.

Monsters include:
- Gulag guard dogs
- White Russians (just normal Russian dudes wearing...linen)
- Hollywood Screenwriters
- Surly Swedes
- Canadian lumberjacks
- Marxist Marmots
- Siberian Mammoths
- Trotskyist Yaks
- Wolves
- Mutant bears
- Radioactive reindeer
- Giant bees
- Chapaev
- Sentient piles of goo
- Five-armed commissars
- Tanks
- Sentient hammers and sickles
- Bourgeiose wererabbits
- ...And other filthy and mutated abominations

Thanks to your highly experimental and definitely safe Boeing Teleporter-737-MAX, you will have a dimensional edge over the Red Bastards. Use it to blink through walls and massacre the enemies of the state.
